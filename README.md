# face-recognition-with-adaboost

the implementation of the standard AdaBoost algorithm to recognize face images. Dataset is  large number of
face images and non-face images. All images are 24x24 pixels
large and the non-face images are random image patches from photos found on the internet. The classifier
distinguishes images of a face from other images using Haar features.
